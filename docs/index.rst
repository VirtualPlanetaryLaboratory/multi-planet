.. note::

    To maximize MultiPlanet's power, run ``VSPACE`` with the ``-bp`` option to automatically
    build the [`BigPlanet`](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/bigplanet) archive immediately after the simulations finish.  Then create 
    BigPlanet files from the archive as needed, and use ``BigPlanet``'s scripting functions to 
    extract vectors and matrices for plotting, statistical analyses, etc.
