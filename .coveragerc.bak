# Coverage configuration for multiplanet
source = multiplanet

# Multiplanet uses a hybrid testing strategy:
# 1. Unit tests (tests/unit/) - Import modules directly for code coverage
# 2. Integration tests (tests/*/) - Call CLI via subprocess for end-to-end validation
#
# Unit tests provide code coverage metrics by importing multiplanet.multiplanet
# and multiplanet.mpstatus modules directly. Integration tests validate the
# user-facing CLI interface by calling multiplanet/mpstatus as subprocess commands.
#
# This approach combines the best of both worlds: measurable coverage from unit
# tests and real-world validation from integration tests.
