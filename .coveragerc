# Coverage configuration for multiplanet
source = multiplanet

# Note: Coverage will show 0% for multiplanet because tests invoke
# the CLI tools as subprocess commands (multiplanet, mpstatus) rather
# than importing Python modules directly. This is expected and normal
# for CLI tool testing.
#
# To test coverage properly, tests would need to:
# 1. Import multiplanet.multiplanet and multiplanet.mpstatus modules directly
# 2. Use coverage.py's subprocess tracking (complex configuration)
#
# The current approach validates the CLI interface, which is what users
# actually interact with, so this testing strategy is appropriate.

[report]
# Ignore missing coverage since tests use subprocess
